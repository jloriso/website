                                Hello, I'm Joseph Loriso, a Computer Science major at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Beyond the world of coding,
                                I lead the Cross Country and Track and Field teams as their captain and volunteer at WIIT 88.9 FM, our on-campus radio
                                station. I currently hold the position of Program Director, where I manage the station's automation and help with
                                the onboarding process for new DJs. 
                            </p><br>
                            <p>
                                Graduating as the Salutatorian of my high school class in 2021 laid the foundation for a journey where academic
                                excellence, athletic achievements, and community engagement intersect. As an Eagle Scout, I've embraced the values of
                                leadership, service, and outdoor exploration, shaping my character and guiding my approach to challenges.
                            </p><br>
                            <p>
                                During my internship as a Full Stack Developer with the Walsh Group, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in both 
                                front-end and back-end development. This role allowed me to apply my knowledge of Computer Science in a practical setting,
                                 contributing to the development and modernization of a web application for the company's onsite employees. I collaborated 
                                 closely with a team of experienced developers, gaining insights into modern development frameworks and practices. This experience 
                                 not only enhanced my technical skills as well as painted a picture of what larger scale projects look like.
                                 It also taught me the importance of teamwork and effective communication in achieving project 
                                 goals. I'm very grateful to the Walsh Group for giving me this oppurtunity and allowing me 
                                 to take a pivotal step in my journey as a developer.
                            </p>
