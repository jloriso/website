            <p class="expiernece-description">
                This past summer I had the oppurtunity to work with Walsh Construction. I worked in their IT department
                doing full stack development. Over the course of the summer I further improved my front end development skills.
                I was introduced ot telerik tools that enhances the user interface and functionality. On the backend I was exposed
                to the complexity of routing data that a user inputs, through a backend framework, and then saved in a database.
                I also gained experience using best practices in database organization. Our team also prioritized data validation
                through all layers of the project. In order to do this we updated backend logic and API endpoints that were responsible
                for data handling. Lastly, I got the oppurtunity to work with legacy code that utilized ASP.NET web forms framework
                to ensure continued functionality in alignment with current standards.
