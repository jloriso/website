            <p class="expiernece-description">
                As a teaching assistant for object-oriented programming, I supported students in developing strong
                foundational skills in programming principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
                My role involved leading lab sessions, where I helped students apply theoretical concepts to
                practical coding exercises and guiding them through challenges in Java. I also held office hours
                and offered one-on-one support, helping students debug their code, helping students study for
                exams in other classes, and offering advice about college in general.
                By fostering an environment where students felt comfortable asking
                questions, I aimed to boost their confidence and competence in object-oriented programming.
                This experience sharpened my teaching skills and deepened my understanding of object oriented design.
